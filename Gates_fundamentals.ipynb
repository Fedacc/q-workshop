    "## Bits, Qubits and Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Quantum computation, similarly to its classical counterpart, is often described and discussed in terms of a circuital model. Information carriers are called _quantum bits_ (_qubits_ in short) and will be represented with straight lines. The flow of information is controlled by single- or multi-qubit operations known as _quantum gates_ which are represented as boxes with input and output qubit wires. During the quantum computation and at the end of it, classical information, including for example the memory slots in which the results of specific operations are stored, is carried around by classical bits, represented by double straight lines. We have already seen some examples of _quantum circuits_, i.e. collections of qubits (i.e. _quantum registers_), _classical registers_ of bits and operations, in [Part 0-Introduction](./Introduction.ipynb), but we will present here their properties in greater detail. In general terms, there are three fundamental stages common to any quantum computation protocol:</p>\n",

    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> __input preparation__, i.e. encoding of the initial information into the quantum state of $N$ qubits;</p>\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'> __processing of the information__, which is carried out by controlling the physical evolution of the qubits, with quantum gates corresponding to unitary transformations;</p>\n",
    "* <p style='text-align: justify;'>__output readout__, which is performed by measuring (in the quantum mechanical sense) some specific properties of the qubits. Since quantum measurements are intrinsically probabilistic, the same is also true for many quantum algorithms.</p>\n",

At the end of a cicruit, the state on any qubit can be read to reveal whether, for example, the qubit itself is found in $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ or $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. This is known as a _measure in the computational basis_. When the state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\alpha\\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\beta\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ contains both $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ components, the outcome of a single measure is probabilistic, and the two results are observed with probabilities $p_0 = \\left|\\alpha\\right|^2$ and $p_1 = \\left|\\beta\\right|^2$. If the same circuit is repeated several times (the keyword option in qiskit is `shots`), then the statistics of outcomes can easily be reconstructed. As an example, we can add a measure to the circuit `qc0`, simulate it 1024 times and see how many times the classical bit on which we store the result is 0, given that the state on the qubit is $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ </p>"

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Before concluding this section on quantum gates, let us consider a final example involving a three-qubit gate, known as the Toffoli gate. This is a generalization of the $\\mathrm{CNOT}$ seen above to the case of two _control_ qubit and one _target_ qubit. The Toffoli gate flips the target qubit (i.e. applies a $\\mathrm{X}$ gate) if and only if _both_ controls are in $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. The usual simbolic notation for the Toffoli gate is therefore $\\mathrm{C}^2\\mathrm{X}$ or $\\mathrm{CCX}$. In mathematical terms, its action on the computational basis is:\n",
